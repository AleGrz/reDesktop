# reDesktop

A tool for auto-generating and managing Rainmeter suites.

# Setup

Before generating a suite, you will have to do some preparations. First, select the skins in the skins tab that you want
the program to choose randomly from. Make sure that you have them CLEAN installed (they shouldn't be modified in any
way) using the links below in credits. Next, in the settings tab you have to fill those settings that have (*) before
them.

Here's a brief explanation of the basic settings:
- Screen Width - Horizontal screen resolution (only 1 monitor setup currently supported)
- Screen Height - Vertical screen resolution
- Rainmeter path - Path to Rainmeter.exe (Usually it's C:\Program Files\Rainmeter) WARNING! Please use "/" instead of "\"
- Skins path - Path to Rainmeter's skins folder (Usually it's C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins) WARNING!
Please use "/" instead of "\"

Those settings aren't necessary, but you can play with them to achieve results that you like more:
- Wallpaper Source - The source you get the wallpaper from
- Subreddit - Subreddit from which the wallpapers will be parsed (Only for reddit as source, don't write 'r/')
- Wallpaper Keyword - The theme for the wallpaper (ex. cars or architecture) The visualisers work best for wallpapers
that have at least one straight line, so if you want a gradient theme I suggest unchecking all visualisers in the skins
tab.
- There are more settings, I will post an explanation to them soon.
